# AI-Assisted Weather Map üó∫Ô∏è
This project is an interactive map designed to visualize complex weather data in a simple and user-friendly way. It uses AI assistance to process and display real-time, forecast, and historical weather information from official government sources.

How It Works
The map works in three main steps, using AI to bridge the gap between raw scientific data and a clear, interactive visualization.

1. Data Fetching üì°
The map connects directly to official government APIs (like those from NOAA and the USGS) to get the latest scientific data. This includes:

Precipitation forecasts (rain, snow)

Streamflow and river level predictions

Historical flood and inundation data

This raw data is accurate but often too complex for a simple map.

2. AI-Powered Processing ü§ñ
This is where the AI assistance comes in. Instead of just plotting raw data points, the system uses AI to process, simplify, and add context to the information. This includes:

Summarizing Data: Aggregating thousands of data points into simple, county-wide summaries.

Interpreting Requests: Allowing users to potentially ask questions in natural language.

Processing Geospatial Data: Performing complex tasks like calculating how gridded rainfall data applies to specific county shapes.

Essentially, the AI acts as a smart assistant that translates the complex scientific data into a clean, map-ready format.

3. Interactive Visualization ‚ú®
Once the data is processed, it's displayed on an interactive map (powered by Mapbox). You can then explore the data through several key features:

Dynamic Layers: See data like precipitation volume shown with intuitive color gradients.

Time-Slider & Animation: A "play" button and slider let you watch how a forecast (like a week of rain) changes over time.

Interactive Popups: Hover or click on a specific county or river gauge to see detailed charts and exact data values.
