# CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)

## Introduction

The CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), developed by the Geospatial Research, Analysis, & Services Program (GRASP) within the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), helps public health officials and emergency planners identify communities that may need extra support before, during, and after disasters.

## What Is Social Vulnerability?

Social vulnerability describes how a community’s social and economic conditions influence its ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazardous events—whether natural (e.g., hurricanes, floods, disease outbreaks) or human-caused (e.g., chemical spills).

Communities exhibiting:

- High poverty  
- Low vehicle access  
- Crowded housing  
- Other adverse conditions are more likely to experience greater human suffering and financial loss during emergencies.

## What Is the CDC/ATSDR SVI?

The SVI ranks all U.S. census tracts, counties, and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) according to 16 social factors.  
These factors are grouped into four major themes, with each tract receiving:

- A ranking for each variable  
- A ranking for each theme  
- An overall social vulnerability ranking  

## The Four SVI Themes and Variables

### 1. Socioeconomic Status
- Below 150% Poverty  
- Unemployed  
- Housing Cost Burden  
- No High School Diploma  
- No Health Insurance  

### 2. Household Characteristics
- Aged 65 & Older  
- Aged 17 & Younger  
- Civilian with a Disability  
- Single-Parent Households  
- English Language Proficiency  

### 3. Racial & Ethnic Minority Status*
Includes individuals who identify as:
- Hispanic or Latino (of any race)  
- Black or African American, Not Hispanic or Latino  
- American Indian and Alaska Native, Not Hispanic or Latino  
- Asian, Not Hispanic or Latino  
- Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, Not Hispanic or Latino  
- Two or More Races, Not Hispanic or Latino  
- Other Races, Not Hispanic or Latino  

### 4. Housing Type & Transportation
- Multi-Unit Structures  
- Mobile Homes  
- Crowding  
- No Vehicle  
- Group Quarters  

## How the SVI Helps Communities

The SVI provides socially and spatially relevant insights that enable communities to better prepare for and recover from disasters. It can be used to:

- Assess community needs for emergency preparedness.  
- Estimate supplies (food, water, medicine, bedding) required during a crisis.  
- Determine emergency personnel requirements.  
- Identify areas needing shelters and evacuation support.  
- Plan for populations with special needs (elderly, non-English speakers, those without vehicles).  
- Support long-term recovery and equitable distribution of aid.  

## Purpose and Impact

By combining social data with geospatial mapping, the SVI helps ensure that vulnerable communities receive timely and appropriate support.  
It serves as a crucial tool for disaster preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery, promoting equity in public health and emergency management across the United States.
